Merry Christmas EveryoneðŸŽ„ðŸ¥‚

This will be the first time participating in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) and I will be posting my implementations here.

[day2](./day2.py) - first part was easy for me but part2 was just tough to crack, I will not consider it.[question here](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/2)
